### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
**Waterfall process**
```
Time-consuming; may have to start over if problems pop up.

- Plan          |       
- Design        |
- Implement     |           Waterfall process
- Test          |
- Deploy        |
- Maintain      V
```
### Other notable things
**Backward Compatibility**
```
Consider a case where you add a parameter to one of your existing class, and you update its usage anywhere in your code.

In this case, you can't go back to the previous version should there be any bug, because your update affects other codes.
```
**Version format**
```
A version comprises of 3 parts X.Y.Z where each part X, Y and Z are non-negative integers with no leading zeroes

- X is called the major version - major changes to the package which will break your codes

- Y is called the minor version - add new features to the package

- Z is called the patch version - fix bugs which may break you codes

Something to look up: SemVer Specification

**Git Workflows**
```

```
**To do**
```
TCP/IP -> Java -> Gradle -> Git workflows
